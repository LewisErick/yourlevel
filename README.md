# Your Level
######by Luis Erick Zul Rabasa

###Overview
Project made in Unity3D using C# to parse a text file that will make you able to insert and position characters in a level you create!
This project uses the data submitted through http://scitumedu.com/yourlevel/, but the current version is only available by

This project is used to teach people from all ages the basics of Object Oriented Programming.
